## Cruise Booking MVC App
The Celebrity Cruise Booking MVC App is a web application that streamlines the booking process for Celebrity Cruises' premium cruises. The app will allow customers to conveniently submit booking requests, including personal information, cruise type, and number of passengers. The application will then process this information and display a confirmation page with complete booking information to the user.
 
#Purpose of the Application:
This project enhances the booking experience for customers interested in Celebrity Cruises by providing a user-friendly platform for submitting booking requests. By undertaking this project, we aim to solve the problem of cumbersome booking processes, making it easier and more efficient for customers to book their desired cruise packages. The beneficiaries of this project include both potential customers interested in booking Celebrity Cruises and the company itself, which will benefit from increased customer satisfaction and streamlined booking processes. Failure to initiate this project may result in decreased customer satisfaction, potential loss of customers to competitors with more user-friendly booking systems, and inefficiencies in managing booking requests.
